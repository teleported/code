Exactly

Can

me
they
pleased
of

The
wiser
youngsters
of
to-day:
--So

If
not,
If
studious

His

Kingston,

Ballantyne

Or
Cooper

So

And

And

share
the
grave
Where
these
and
their

lie!

him

"Pew!"

cried,

"Now,
Morgan,"
said
Long
John,
very
sternly,
"you
never

Dog

you,
now?"

It
was
something
to
see
him

AT
THE
"ADMIRAL
BENBOW"
Squire
Trelawney,
Doctor
Livesey,
and
the
rest
of
these
gentlemen
having
asked
me
to
write
down
the
whole
particulars
about
Treasure
Island,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end,
keeping
nothing
back
but
the
bearings
of
the
island,
and
that
only
because
there
is
still
treasure
not
yet
lifted,
I
take
up
my
pen
in
the
year
of
grace
17--,
and
go
back
to
the
time
when
my
father
kept
the
"Admiral
Benbow"
Inn,
and
the
brown
old
seaman,
with
the
saber
cut,
first
took
up
his
lodging
under
our
roof.
